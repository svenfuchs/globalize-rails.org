        <li><a href="http://www.crispynews.com">CrispyNews</a> &#8212; Create your own community news site! We&#8217;ve gotten alot of international interest in our application, but we only support english. We&#8217;re currently installing globalize and our intention is to have a globalization module that&#8217;ll let anyone port crispynews into their own language. <br /><br />Update: Globalize was successfully installed, and we&#8217;ve even extended it into an interesting &#8220;fun project&#8221; which retreives automatic translations from sites like Babelfish and Google translate for phrases that have not been translated yet. The translations are not really usable without significant modification, but those interested in making similar enhancements can read the article <a href="http://blog.kenlet.com/articles/2006/03/31/internationalization-with-the-help-of-google-translate">Internationalization with Rails, Globalize and Google</a> We chose it over some other Ruby globalization libraries because of its rails-y feel. We look forward to continually incorporating future versions as they make further optimizations and improvements are released. &#8211; <em>crispynews coders</em>.</li>
